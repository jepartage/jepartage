                    <div id='text'>Hey, it's Jason.  I'm constructing something here, something big!  And by big I mean new, and by new I mean overdue, and by constructing I mean neglecting, and by overdue I mean unnecessary, and by neglecting I mean forgot about, and by unnecessary I mean something that no one outside of my immediate family cares about.  Are we all clear now?<br><br>Naw, just kidding.  I'll be putting new stuff here when I get the chance.  Until then enjoy everything that there is to see here, absolutely nothing.
